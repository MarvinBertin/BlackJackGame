# BlackJackGame
Black Jack Game implementation in Python

This is simplified version of the game:
- There is only the dealer and one player.
- The player can only hit or stay (no split or double down).

Some notes on the implementation:
- The dealerplays by the rules of hitting at 16 or lower, staying at 17 or higher.
- The player starts with 50$
- The player wins or loses 10$ at every round
- The player plays until bankrupt or quitting.
